# Abalone-Age-Prediction-Project



Problem Statement
The age determination of abalone, a valuable marine mollusk, is currently a time-consuming and invasive process that involves cutting the shell and counting growth rings. This traditional method not only poses a threat to the abalone population but also hinders efficient resource management. To address this challenge, there is a growing need for a non-invasive and accurate age prediction model based on easily measurable physical attributes. The aim of this study is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the age of abalone using features such as shell dimensions, weight, and other physical characteristics. The development of a reliable age prediction model would not only streamline the age estimation process but also contribute to the sustainable management of abalone populations.
